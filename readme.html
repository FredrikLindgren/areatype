    <h1>fl#areatype</h1>

    <p>This modder's resource defines two new area types for the
      Baldur's Gate II engine. The area type <code>FL_INN</code>
      encompasses interior inn areas and the area type
      <code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code> encompasses interior stronghold
      areas, analogously to how the standard area types
      <code>CITY</code> and <code>FOREST</code> encompass outdoor city
      areas and forest areas, respectively. The new areas types can be
      used the same way the standard area types can be used, with the
      <code>AreaType()</code> trigger or the
      <code>AddAreaType()</code> action. This allows for easy
      detection of inn and stronghold areas in scripts and dialogues,
      instead of having to use long lists of <code>AreaCheck()</code>
      triggers.</p>

    <p>Current supported games are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Baldur's Gate II</em>, including <em>Throne of Bhaal</em></li>
        <li><em>EasyTutu</em></li>
        <li><em>Baldur's Gate Trilogy</em></li>
        <li><em>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition</em></li>
        <li><em>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition</em></li>
        <li><em>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy</em></li>
      </ul>
    <p>The <em>Black Pits</em> additions of
      <em>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition</em> and <em>Baldur's Gate
      II: Enhanced Edition</em> are currently unsupported.</p>

    <h2>Common details</h2>
    <p>The unmodified BG2 engine has 8 area types defined. However,
      the engine allows for up to 16 area types. fl#areatype makes use of
      this empty space to define its new area types. The area
      types are added dynamically and non-cumulatively. This means the
      exact, numerical value of the area types can vary from
      installation to installation, but never between different mods
      on the same installation. It also means one or both of the area
      types can safely be installed multiple times on top of each
      other or on top of other instances of the same area type.</p>

    <p>The implementations of both area types are completely
      self-contained and independent. They are available as separate
      <code>TPA</code> files and can be included in any WeiDU mod
      through the <code>INCLUDE</code> action. The <code>FL_INN</code>
      area type is contained within the file fl_inn.tpa and,
      analogously, <code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code> is contained within the
      file fl_stronghold.tpa.</p>

    <p>To be included in a mod, the relevant .tpa file simply needs to
      be copied to somewhere within the mod folder and invoked with
      the <code>INCLUDE</code> action. As an example,
      <code>FL_INN</code> could be included in the mod MyMod by
      copying the file fl_inn.tpa to the location MyMod/lib/fl_inn.tpa
      and by including the line <code>INCLUDE
      ~MyMod/lib/fl_inn.tpa~</code> in the mod's .tp2 file. After
      that, any scripts or dialogues containing the area
      type <code>FL_INN</code> can be compiled and used.</p>

    <h2>Details of <code>FL_INN</code></h2>
    <p>An inn is approximately defined as a locale where you can rent
      a bed and buy a drink. <code>FL_INN</code> covers BG1 and BG2,
      as well as a wide range of mods. Most of the inns covered by
      <code>FL_INN</code> are located in a city or village, but there
      are a handful of exceptions. A full list of which areas are
      covered by <code>FL_INN</code> is available
      <a href="fl_inn.html">here</a>. All areas are flagged at install
      time when the file fl_inn.tpa is <code>INCLUDE</code>d.</p>

    <h4>Requirements</h4>
    <p>Unless your mod excludes BG1, <code>FL_INN</code> requires that
      the <a href="https://github.com/FredrikLindgren/bg1pal">BG1
      Platform-Abstraction Library</a> be loaded prior to inclusion of
      the file fl_inn.tpa.</p>

    <h4>Compatibility</h4>
    <p>Since <code>FL_INN</code> flags areas at install time, it is
      not able to affect mod-added areas that are installed
      afterwards.</p>

    <h2>Details of <code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code></h2>
    <p><code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code> provides an area type for the
      strongholds of BG2, including the ToB pocket plane. Stronghold
      areas you can not reach until you've obtained the stronghold
      (such as the de'Arnise keep) are flagged at install time when
      the file fl_stronghold.tpa is <code>INCLUDE</code>d. Areas which
      later become part of the stronghold (such as the Planar Sphere)
      are flagged when the stronghold is obtained.</p>

    <p>Due to technical limitations, the <code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code>
      area type will continue to return true even if the player has
      lost the stronghold. The WeiDU variable
      <code>fl#StrongholdKickedOut</code> is defined as a complement
      intended to mitigate this shortcoming. The variable will be
      false if the player is in an area that is not a stronghold or if
      the player is in a stronghold area they have been kicked out
      of. Please note that the variable
      <code>fl#StrongholdKickedOut</code> cannot be negated or used
      inside an <code>OR()</code> trigger, as it itself contains
      <code>OR()</code> triggers. To use the WeiDU variable
      <code>fl#StrongholdKickedOut</code> in a script or dialogue, it
      needs to be enclosed in percentage signs and placed in the
      trigger of a dialogue state or script. The script or dialogue
      then needs to be compiled with the <code>EVAL</code>
      (<code>EVALUATE_BUFFER</code>) WeiDU option.</p>

    <h4>Compatibility</h4>
    <p><code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code> is compatible with
      multiple-stronghold tweaks, provided they set the main
      stronghold variable. Specifically,
      <code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code> is compatible with the
      multiple-stronghold tweaks of the G3 BG2 Tweakpack and Sword
      Coast Stratagems II.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>Script being compiled with the <code>FL_STRONGHOLD</code> area
      type and the <code>fl#StrongholdKickedOut</code> variable:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .../flscript.baf
      IF
        Global("flCommentOnStronghold","LOCALS",0)
        AreaType(FL_STRONGHOLD)
        !AreaCheck("AR4500")
        %fl#StrongholdKickedOut%
      THEN
        RESPONSE #100
          SetGlobal("flCommentOnStronghold","LOCALS",1)
          Interact(Player1)
      END
      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

      COMPILE flscript.baf EVAL
