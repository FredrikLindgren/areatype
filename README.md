# fl#areatype

This modder's resource defines two new area types for the Baldur's
Gate II engine. The area type ```FL_INN``` encompasses interior
inn areas and the area type ```FL_STRONGHOLD``` encompasses
interior stronghold areas, analogously to how the standard area types
```CITY``` and ```FOREST``` encompass outdoor city areas
and forest areas, respectively.

All variants of Baldur's Gate (which themselves support area types)
and Baldur's Gate II are supported, as well as a large number of mods.

For more extensive documentation, please refer to the file
readme.html.
